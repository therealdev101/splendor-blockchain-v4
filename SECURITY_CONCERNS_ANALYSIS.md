# Security Analysis: Actual Issues to Fix

## REAL ISSUES THAT NEED IMPLEMENTATION:

### 1. ✅ **ValidatorController Slashing Integration** 
**Problem**: Slashed validators don't lose ValidatorController tier-based rewards
**Fix**: Integrate slashing system with ValidatorController

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

### Implementation: ValidatorController Slashing Integration
- Add slashing hooks to ValidatorController
- Forfeit accumulated rewards when validators are slashed
- Return forfeited rewards to reward pool for honest validators
- Implement tier-based punishment (higher tiers lose more)
- Add admin controls for unbanning validators

## SYSTEM CONTRACTS REVIEW:

**Validators.sol** (F000):
- ✅ Has slashValidator() function ready
- ✅ Has tier-based system
- ✅ Ready for integration

**ValidatorController.sol**:
- ✅ Has tier-based rewards ($1,500/$15,000/$150,000)
- ✅ Has admin approval system
- ❌ No slashing integration - needs hooks

**Slashing.sol** (F007):
- ✅ Has complete double-signing detection
- ✅ Has functional slashing mechanism
- ❌ No ValidatorController integration

**Other contracts** (Punish.sol, Proposal.sol, Params.sol):
- ✅ Well implemented, no changes needed

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Design ValidatorController slashing integration
2. Implement slashing hooks in ValidatorController
3. Test integration between Slashing.sol and ValidatorController.sol
