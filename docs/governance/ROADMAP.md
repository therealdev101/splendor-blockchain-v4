## 🌌 Splendor Scaling Roadmap — Full Picture

### 1. Math Ceiling (Baseline)
- **300B gas / block**
- **21k gas / tx**
- **1s blocks**

👉 **Theoretical max = ~14.28M TPS** (but unreachable with today's hardware/architecture)

### 2. Current State (Today)
- **45 validators** (all 8 cores)
- **3 RPCs** (32 cores each)
- **Multi-threaded parallel engine**

👉 **~30k–50k TPS chain-wide** (validators are bottleneck, not RPCs)

### 3. Scaling by Validator Core Count

| Validator Core Count | With Parallel Engine (multi-threaded) | Chain-Wide Realistic TPS |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 8 cores (today)    | 30k–50k TPS                         | ⚡ Current ceiling      |
| 16 cores           | 80k–100k TPS                        | ~2× increase           |
| 32 cores           | 150k–200k TPS                       | Sweet spot for scaling |
| 64 cores           | 250k–400k TPS                       | Datacenter-grade       |
| 128 cores          | 500k+ TPS                           | Near hardware max      |

### 4. Beyond 128 Cores: Post-CPU Scaling

#### 1. GPU Offload 🎯
- **Signature verification → GPU** (A100/H100, RTX 5090)
- **Millions of sigs/sec** → frees CPU
- **TPS jump**: 500k → 1–2M TPS

**What GPUs Do for Validators:**
- In Ethereum-style blockchains, **65–75% of CPU time** per block is spent on verifying ECDSA signatures and hashing
- On 8-core validators, this caps us at ~30–50k TPS
- **GPUs are built for massively parallel math** (tens of thousands of cores)
- **A single modern GPU** (A100, H100, RTX 4090/5090) can verify **millions of sigs per second**

**Impact Examples:**
- **8-core + GPU**: ~200k–300k TPS (instead of 50k)
- **32-core + GPU**: ~500k+ TPS
- **64-core + GPU**: ~1M+ TPS

#### 2. Memory & State Optimizations
- **In-memory DB** + async disk writes
- **Zero-copy state transitions**
- **TPS jump**: ~2–3×

#### 3. Advanced Parallelism
- **Transaction dependency analysis**
- **Speculative execution + rollback**
- **Unlocks near-linear core scaling**

👉 **Together, these can push Splendor into multi-million TPS territory**

### 5. Consensus & Networking

#### Pipelined Consensus
- Execute block N while voting on block N+1
- Reduces wasted time → smoother throughput

#### Faster Gossip Layer
- TCP → QUIC/UDP
- Block compression, Merkle-diff propagation

#### Validator Colocation (optional)
- 25–100 Gbps networking in same datacenter for ultra-low latency

### 6. Validator Set Growth
Adding validators **does not multiply TPS** (every validator still re-executes each block).
But it does:
- **Increase** decentralization + security
- **Spread** load on networking layer
- **Reduce** centralization risk

👉 With **more validators, TPS ceiling stays the same** unless core specs improve — but the **network remains stable & more secure**

**Example**: 45 validators @ 8 cores → ~50k TPS
If upgraded to **45 validators @ 32 cores → ~200k TPS** without any network reset

### 7. Next-Gen Scaling (Future-Proofing)

#### Sharding / Multi-VM Execution
- Split txs across shards or VMs (EVM, Sealevel, MoveVM)
- Validators only handle their share
- **TPS**: 5–10M+ range

#### zkProof-Assisted Validation
- Block proposer generates zkSNARK → validators verify proof instead of re-executing all txs
- Slashes compute costs for non-leaders
- Could push Splendor **close to theoretical ceiling (10M+ TPS)**

#### AI-driven Auto-Scaling
- Adaptive tuning for batching, gossip, consensus paths
- Optimizes efficiency dynamically at runtime

### 8. The Big Picture (No Network Reset Needed)

- **Short term (today)**: 8-core validators cap at ~50k TPS
- **Mid term (upgrade validators)**: 16–32 cores → 100k–200k TPS
- **High end (64–128 cores)**: 400k–500k TPS
- **Hardware offload (GPU/FPGA)**: 1–2M TPS
- **Architectural upgrades (parallelism + memory)**: 2–3M TPS
- **Future innovations (sharding + zkProofs)**: 5–10M+ TPS, approaching the 14.28M ceiling

👉 **All incremental upgrades** (validator specs, RPC infra, consensus tweaks, offload engines)
👉 **No chain reset needed** — you just evolve validators and protocol features

## ⚡ Bottom Line

- **Your 300B gas ceiling** gives Splendor room to breathe for the long term (~14M TPS max)
- **Today**: ~50k TPS with 8-core validators
- **By stepping validators up** → 32, 64, 128 cores, plus GPU offload + memory/consensus tweaks, you can climb into the **million TPS class** without resetting the chain
- **Final stage** = sharding + zkProofs → unlocks **10M+ TPS scale** while keeping security + decentralization

## 🎯 GPU Acceleration Timeline

### Q2 2025: GPU Integration Phase 1
- **All validators switch to GPU-accelerated signature verification**
- **Target hardware**: RTX 4090/5090, A100, H100
- **Expected impact**: 4-6x throughput increase (50k → 200k-300k TPS)
- **Implementation**: Hybrid CPU+GPU architecture with CUDA/OpenCL integration

### Q3 2025: Optimization & Scaling
- **Validator core count upgrades** (8 → 16 → 32 cores)
- **GPU batch verification optimization**
- **Target**: 500k+ TPS with 32-core + GPU setup

### Q4 2025: Advanced Hardware Integration
- **64-128 core validator deployments**
- **Advanced GPU offloading** for hashing and state operations
- **Target**: 1M+ TPS capability

This comprehensive scaling approach ensures Splendor can grow from today's 50k TPS to multi-million TPS without any network resets or fundamental architecture changes.
