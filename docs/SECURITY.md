## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Splendor team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@splendor.org**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We will perform an initial assessment of the reported vulnerability within 5 business days.

3. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the issue and determine its validity and severity.

4. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities. The timeline depends on the complexity and severity of the issue.

5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline. We prefer to disclose vulnerabilities after a fix is available.

6. **Recognition**: We will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep your node updated** to the latest version
- **Use strong passwords** and enable 2FA where possible
- **Secure your private keys** and never share them
- **Verify transaction details** before confirming
- **Use official channels** for downloads and updates

### For Developers

- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Validate all inputs** thoroughly
- **Use established cryptographic libraries**
- **Implement proper access controls**
- **Regular security audits** of your code

### For Validators

- **Secure your validator infrastructure**
- **Use firewalls** to restrict access
- **Monitor your nodes** for unusual activity
- **Keep backups** of important data
- **Use hardware security modules** for key management

## Known Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

- **Reentrancy attacks**: Use reentrancy guards
- **Integer overflow/underflow**: Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+
- **Access control**: Implement proper role-based access
- **Front-running**: Consider commit-reveal schemes

### Network Security

- **Eclipse attacks**: Maintain diverse peer connections
- **DDoS attacks**: Use rate limiting and load balancing
- **Man-in-the-middle**: Always use HTTPS/WSS connections

### Validator Security

- **Key management**: Use secure key storage solutions
- **Slashing conditions**: Understand and avoid slashing scenarios
- **Infrastructure security**: Secure your validator nodes
